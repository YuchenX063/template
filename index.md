## The project

- Research question: I am studying the use cases of different web architecture environments, because I want to understand which web architecture best displays large amounts of data for a user and what are the advantages of using an API over a flat website in terms of presenting and offering data to the user, so that users might maximize benefit from an accessible and sustainable project.

## About me

Below are a couple of ways you might include images in your site. The simplest is to use Markdown's image method. Use a !, then put the alt text you want inside of square brackets, and the link inside of parentheses.
![This is the alt text that will appear on mouseover](assets/img/bcds-logo.webp)

If you want to layout two images side by side, you can use Markdown's tables to organize them into a table of two or more columns... you can add rows for captions if you want.

| Caption 1 | Caption 2 |

If you want a single image, center aligned... you have to use raw HTML... use this as a guide, and replace the filename with yours

<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/img/bcds-logo.webp" />
</p>
