Below are a couple of ways you might include images in your site. The simplest is to use Markdown's image method. Use a !, then put the alt text you want inside of square brackets, and the link inside of parentheses.

If you want to layout two images side by side, you can use Markdown's tables to organize them into a table of two or more columns... you can add rows for captions if you want.

| ![BCDS Logo](assets/img/bcds-logo.webp) | ![BCDS Logo](assets/img/bcds-logo.webp) |
| Caption 1 | Caption 2 |

If you want a single image, center aligned... you have to use raw HTML... use this as a guide, and replace the filename with yours

<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/img/bcds-logo.webp" />
</p>
