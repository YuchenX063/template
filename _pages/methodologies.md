As introduced in the section “Context” (link), there are various types of data – catholic institutions and people – in the almanacs. What’s more, these data are interconnected with each other: in a specific year, for example, a church may be attending a few other smaller churches, while having multiple priests residing in it. In other words, as shown in the picture below, there are a lot of many-to-many relationships between catholic institutions (for the sake of simplicity, I named them “church”) and catholic institutions, as well as between catholic institutions and people.
