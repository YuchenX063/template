## The Two Web Frameworks

There are many web frameworks that can build a database as well as a website that can query the database and display data to users. In this project, I am using and comparing two of them: Django, which is written in Python, and Nodejs/Angular, which are written in JavaScript. 

- Django (Python)

The Django framework is a relatively simple (flat) web framework that does not have an API or a front end. As this data flow chart shows, the data stored in the back end will be directly sent to the webpage filtered by the user’s queries. In other words, whenever a user browses or searches for data in the website, the database back end is directly queried, and the data that fulfill the user’s criteria are directly fed to the HTML templates and displayed.
