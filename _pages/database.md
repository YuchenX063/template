Since both websites are not running on a server right now, I am illustrating them with screenshots of how they look like when running locally. This site will be updated once I put the website onto a server.

## The Django website

<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/img/django website.png" width="700"/>
  <em>Home Page</em>
</p>

If we click St. Mary's in 1870 Albany, we land on this page: 
<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/img/django-inst-detail.png" width="700"/>
  <em>The detail page of St. Mary's</em>
</p>

Then, by clicking the name "Rev. C. Walworth," we can browse this person detail page:
<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/img/django-pers-detail.png" width="700"/>
  <em>The detail page of Rev. C. Walworth</em>
</p>

We can also use the search bars to search for or filter institutions:
<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/img/django-search.png" width="700"/>
  <em>The result page of St. Mary's in Boston and related people</em>
</p>

Or search by person name:
<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/img/django-search-pers.png" width="700"/>
  <em>the result page of people named John and related institutions</em>
</p>


## The Nodejs/Angular website
