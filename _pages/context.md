This database is part of the Catholic Almanacs project, and the Digital Scholarship Group at Boston College has been working on it for a year. The overall goal is to turn U.S. Catholic Almanacs from 1833 to 1895 into a searchable database. For a more detailed contextual introduction of how the metadata is recorded in almanacs and how students extract and transcribe metadata onto google spreadsheets,  visit [this site](https://yuchenx063.github.io/template/web_framaeworks).

  <em>An example of how metadata is structured in almanacs</em>
</p>

In general, the Catholic almanacs record the information of different Catholic institutions like churches, cathedrals, schools, hospitals, etc. and Catholic people like pastors of every single year. Besides the metadata, the almanacs also contain the information of the relations between specific institutions and people. For example, in the picture shown above, the almanac records that in 1870, in the diocese of Dubuque, in Dubuque City, St. Raphael’s Cathedral has people like Rt. Rev. John Hennesay, D.D., Very Rev. Thomas O’Belly, Rev. R. Ryan, and others residing in it. Similarly, for some institutions, they can also be “attended by” larger institutions. This is how (meta)data originally looks like in the Catholic almanacs.
